Discord bot using markov technics that's supposed to talk like my friend

Rather simple markov bot made using this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97yQMT0jn8 (I added some minor changes)

Not gonna post the main file containing actual meat of the bot as it reveals some ID's and stuff, but feel free to add him to your server and use $mankov to generate random stuff (it rarely makes sense so it does good job at imitating original)

Once it wakes up though because I'm pretty sure it's timed out at the moment due to a lot of request I did while editing (or something like that I'm not really sure)
